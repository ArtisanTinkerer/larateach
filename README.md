## About Larateach

Larateach is written to utilise the Wonde API.

### User Story:
As a Teacher I want to be able to see which students are in my class each day of the week so that I can be suitably 
prepared.

## Artisan command
The signature is: 
```php artisan students:get <employeeId>```

 
## Todo
* don't like the nested foreach
* in the real world the service class would have an interface.
* handle the Wonde API not being available.
